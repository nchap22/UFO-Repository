# UFO-Repository
# Overview of the analysis:

## The purpose 
The purpose is Dana has a webpage and dynamic table and they work but her goal is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to be able to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Also, the user would not only be able to filter date but would be able to filter city, state, country, and shape

## There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. 
Once the user opens the website they would see an area on the left hand side called filter search and would be able to select from the date, city, state, country, or shape filter. Then the page will pull sightings for that search. An example of this is below:

## The summary 
The website gives users the ability to filter data using 5 main filters (date, city, ctate, country, shape). However, I feel like one drawback isit doesn't include the time of day that this was witnessed and it doesn't include how many people witnessed the sighting. I feel like adding these detials would make the data more valid. 
## The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development 
I recommend adding two more filters, one for the time of day and one for how many peopel witnessed the sightings.
